This repository contains all the SceneKit samples.

## [Earth with Clouds] (earthWithCloud/earthWithCloud.md)
This sample demonstrates how to display rotating globe with clouds around it. You can read more about the implementation detail [here](earthWithCloud/earthWithCloud.md).  
**Note** The sample is based on the code and resources provided in WWDC 2013 - SceneKit Session.

## [Globe with Clouds - App]
This sample is similar to previous sample: EarthWithClouds. In this sample I have created an App, instead of playground. This allows you to switch on/off features to see how those impact the output. Also scenekit output quality on the device is much better than the simulator so I would recommend you to run this sample on the actual device.  

The output will look like as shown below:
